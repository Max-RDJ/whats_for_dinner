TODO:
- Make meal text editable in place on MM
    - Manual save needs to work by index; first meal data is being saved in every case
- Make page remember re-arranged order of meal items
- Collapse meal item text into one column on smaller screens
- Reverse order of meals array so that most recently added or edited is displayed first
-Replace numbers on index with something more fun and visually appealing; wheel of fortune?
- Apply sequential fade in to generated meals on index
- Produce shopping list
- Create a 'tutorial' if no content is displayed on page or if no saved data

MAYBE:
- Webscrape ingredients prices
- Save and date the week of meals generated for future ref
